__[PROJECT 1](  https://github.com/MissCheptoo/EXCEL_PROJECTS/tree/main/%20INVESTMENT_ANALYSIS): INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DASHBOARD USING EXCEL__

I created my this dashboard in Excel showcasing cumulative growth, risk analysis, and projected returns over time. I got the data from [CHATGPT](https://1drv.ms/x/c/a153e5ee08670d95/ER331l1FFCBBkd6_2R5g5vcBxhkxTH05D2xct63rI0Ev7Q).  Using Excelâ€™s analytical tools, I visualized key metrics to identify trends and evaluate risks across various investments. I did some cleaning, i.e., converting texts to numbers. 

SUMMARY

Average Returns by Investment: This section compares the expected returns for various investments, indicating which assets may be more profitable over time. Based on the data, high-return investments like the S&P 500 Index Fund stand out as the most profitable, suggesting potential areas for increased focus in the portfolio, which helps guide future investment decisions.

Portfolio Allocation by Annual Growth Rates: The pie chart showcases the distribution of investments according to their growth rates. Cryptocurrency and Emerging Markets ETFs take up notable portions, reflecting higher growth potential.

Investment Allocation and Risk Levels: The dashboard also breaks down initial investment allocations and groups investments by risk level. Tech Stock Portfolio, Cryptocurrency, High-Yield-Saving, and Small-Cap stocks are all high-risk investments, allowing for risk-aligned decision-making.

Expected Monetary Return Over Time: The chart illustrates projected growth for each investment across different time horizons. The S&P 500 Index and Real Estate Fund show significant returns over longer terms, indicating their potential as long-term investments.

This project reflects my focus on data-driven financial analysis to make informed investment decisions.
